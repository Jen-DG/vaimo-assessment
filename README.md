# vaimo-assessment

To run the code: download the zip file and run using visual studio code.

I used JavaScrip for this project. I called the given api and extracted the data in a javaScript file. I wanted to do it using React but couldnt figure out how to access the data i needed.
I started with a 3 column layout and did each section from there. I got the information I needed and did styling at the same time. My mobile is not perfect, its something I struggle abit with, normally I would make use of Bootstrap for the responsive mode.

Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JS and VSC. I defiently wouls like to have done this using React I think it would make clearner and more managable code. I struggled abit with this assessment as it was the first time I have done something like this.
